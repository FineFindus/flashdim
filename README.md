## About this project
Starting with Android 13, it's possible to control multiple brightness levels of the flashlight.  
To be able to use this new feature I've developed this app.

Inspired by [polodarb/Flashlight-Tiramisu](https://github.com/polodarb/Flashlight-Tiramisu) ðŸ’›  
Custom SeekBar built with code from [massoudss/waveformSeekBar](https://github.com/massoudss/waveformSeekBar) ðŸ’›

Coming soon on Google Play and F-Droid, until then download the apk from the [releases](https://github.com/cyb3rko/flashdim/releases/).

## Features
- ðŸ”¦ dimming your flashlight level by level
- ðŸŽš shortcut buttons for different brightness levels
- ðŸ†˜ SOS flash button
- âš¡ quick settings tile for fast access
- ðŸ”’ private, no ads, no internet connection
- ðŸ’¯ modern Material You (M3) design elements
- ðŸŽ¨ app colors adapt to device's system colors
