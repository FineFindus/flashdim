<b>About</b>
Starting with Android 13, it's possible to control multiple brightness levels of the flashlight.
To be able to use this new feature I've developed this app.

The full functionality of this app is ONLY AVAILABLE for devices which support the dim functionality of the flashlight (hardware limited).
See <a href="https://github.com/cyb3rko/flashdim#supported-devices">Supported devices</a> on GitHub

If you think it's worth to support this project, feel free to give a small donation ♥️.
